# homebridge-bond

Bond plug-in for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) using the [Bond V2 API](http://docs-local.appbond.com). In order to use this plugin, you'll need to make sure your Bond has been updated to firmware v2.

**NOTE: If you are still on v1 (using the Bond Bridge app)**:

- You need to download the new [Bond Home](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bond-home/id1447691811) app and update your firmware.
- After that, follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/aarons22/homebridge-bond/wiki/Migrating-from-v1-to-v2).

Some Bond's may not be able to update to v2 firmware. If so, you can use the [v1 homebrige plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-bond-v1).

## Features

This plugin currently supports the following devices and features:

- Multiple Bonds
- Ceiling Fan
  - Light on/off
  - Up/Down light (no dimming yet)
  - Fan Speeds 1-8 (dynamic based on bond configuration)
  - Light Dimming (`off` by default; see config below)
    - When using this feature, turn the switch on to start dimming. When you reach the brightness level you would like, turn the switch off.
- Blinds
  - Open / Close
- Generic Device
  - On / Off (appears as switch in HomeKit)
- Fireplace
  - Flame On / Off (appears as switch in HomeKit)

You can view the backlog of features [here](https://github.com/aarons22/homebridge-bond/). Feel free to add a feature request in the Issues tab!

## Installation

Assuming a global installation of `homebridge`:

`npm i -g homebridge-bond`

## Homebridge Configuration

Add the `Bond` platform in your homebridge `config.json` file.

### Easiest Configuration

For the best experience setting up this plugin, please use [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x).

### Basic Configuration

To get your Bond IP Address, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/aarons22/homebridge-bond/wiki/Get-Bond-IP-Address). Additionally, you can bypass adding your IP address and simply put your Bond ID from the app. This will make it so that the IP gets resolved from the hostname of the Bond, which includes the Bond ID.

`BOND_TOKEN` (Local token) can be found in the app. Go to your Bond settings:

![alt text](./docs/bond-settings.jpeg 'Bond Settings')

You can tap on each row to copy the contents to the clipboard.

```json
"platforms": [
    {
        "platform": "Bond",
        "bonds": [
            {
                "ip_address": "<BOND_IP_ADDRESS>",
                "token": "<BOND_TOKEN>"
            }
        ],
    }
],
```

## Optional Parameters

| Option             | Default | Explanation                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `include_dimmer`   | false   | If dimming is a valid action on a device, it will be included as additional switch on the accessory. Since this is an odd solution to dimming, it's off by default. |
| `fan_speed_values` | false   | Use fan speed values instead of percentages (i.e. Hey Siri set the Office Fan to 2).                                                                                |

## Development

I'm more than happy to take PRs if you want to fix a bug you are having or take a shot at adding a new feature you're interested in. To compile the code in realtime, run:

```
npm run dev
```

To use the local version of the plugin in homebridge, I run `npm link` in the directory of the cloned repo.
